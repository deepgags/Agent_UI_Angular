	<hr>

	<h3 class="info">Plan Smart, Profit More</h3>
	<p>Investing in home improvements doesn’t always mean you’ll recover the full amount when selling. Careful planning is essential if you want to boost your home’s salability and
		potentially profit from your renovations.</p>
	<p>Sometimes, the least expensive upgrades provide the highest return. For example, interior painting can offer an average 75% payback. A $2,000 paint job could increase your
		home's value by up to $3,500.</p>

	<h3 class="info">Best Paint Choices</h3>
	<p>To attract more buyers, choose neutral shades like whites and soft tones of popular colors. Avoid highly personal or custom touches if you're planning to sell soon, as they
		may not appeal to everyone and can hinder a quick sale.</p>

	<h3 class="info">Focus on Kitchens and Bathrooms</h3>
	<p>Renovating key areas like kitchens and bathrooms can pay off significantly. With average returns of 72% and 68% respectively, upgrades such as new fixtures, cabinets, and
		tiles are often worthwhile.</p>
