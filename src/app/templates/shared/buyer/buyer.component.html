                While the market includes new and resale homes, resale properties are often located in established neighborhoods with mature landscaping and nearby amenities.

                Keep in mind, resale homes have weathered time — with potential signs of aging like settling or minor wear.

                Your offer should outline:
              </p>
              <ul class="text-muted">
                <li>Your proposed purchase price</li>

                A deposit accompanies the offer as a show of good faith. Once accepted and conditions are met, the agreement becomes legally binding.
                Make sure you fully understand the terms before signing. Backing out after acceptance may cost you your deposit or result in legal action.
